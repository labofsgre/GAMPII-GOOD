# GAMPII-GOOD
GAMP II - GOOD (Gnss Observations and prOducts Downloader) is a powerful and easy-to-use lightweight GNSS observations and product downloading toolkit, which is developed by the SASIN (SpAtial SurveyIng and Navigation) group at Shandong University of Science and Technology (SDUST). The current version is 1.6, which is more stable. Hence, we decide to make it available for global GNSS users, and we are convinced that more and more GNSS users will benefit from GAMP II - GOOD. The source codes of GAMP II - GOOD is now available at GitHub (https://github.com/zhouforme0318/GAMPII-GOOD). We dedicated to create a more powerful GNSS data downloading tool, which can allow every GNSSer to completely get rid of the trouble in GNSS data and product downloading.
# Features
Main feature of GAMP II - GOOD are various GNSS observations and products donwloading, i.e., 
- IGS observation (RINEX version 2.xx, short name 'd')
- MGEX observation (RINEX version 3.xx, long name 'crx')
- various type of broadcast ephemeris
- various type of precise orbit 'sp3' and precise clock 'clk'
- earth rotation parameter
- IGS weekly SINEX solution
- CODE and/or MGEX differential code bias (DCB)
- global ionosphere map (GIM)
- rate of TEC index (ROTI)
- real-time precise orbit and clock products from CNES offline files
- real-time code and phase bias products from CNES offline files
- ANTEX format antenna phase center correction
But it is not limited to these, users can use the source code to expand its functionalities according to their needs.
